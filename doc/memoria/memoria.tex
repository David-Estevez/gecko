\section{Introduction}
In this document a gesture recognition software named GECKO is presented. This software will allow the user to interact with a computer using just hand gestures. 

\subsection{Motivation}

\subsection{First Steps}

\subsection{Final Solution}

\section{User Guide}
This code was developed using the following libraries: 
\begin{itemize}
\item OpenCV (v2.4.6.1).
\item X11 (linux native libraries that allows the control of the windows and mouse). 
\end{itemize}
The software was compiled using CMAKE (minimum version 2.8).

\subsection{Compile the software [UBUNTU]}

In order to compile the code, 

\subsection{Use the software}
